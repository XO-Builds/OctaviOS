## Ah, Hey There!

Welcome to the OctaviOS Releases for the Pocophone F1 aka Beryllium!

## A Lil Info About the Project

This is OctaviOS, pronounced as Octavious, the Great Villian from SpiderMan series!

OctaviOS is a comeback of the ROM previously publicized as PearlOS. Some of you might have heard about it. PearlOS was released in Pie and due to a lot of happenings. it died in the Q Era. But we're here, trying to get our mess organised again in a sincere manner!

With the advent of the Android 12, developers have been sparing no efforts to bring it to our beloved Poco F1 aka Beryllium. With most of the Custom ROM Projects dropping Beryllium from their officially maintained devices, its time for Newbies like us to volunteer for the development towards our device and keep the legacy alive! Going with the alleged vision, here I'm dispensing out a whole new addition to the list of Android 12 ROMs for our Beryllium, The OctaviOS 3.0.

## Overview

The [Screenshots](https://github.com/XO-Builds/OctaviOS/blob/main/%5BScreenshots%5DOctaviOS_3.0_Beryllium.pdf) have also been ATTACHED here just for you to get a ROUGH IDEA of how the ROM gonna be like ;)
